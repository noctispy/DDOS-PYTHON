DDOS-PYTHON simulated network load testing tool (command-line) created by Noctis for educational and research purposes. It is designed to model high volumes of HTTP-based traffic in isolated lab environments only. The project supports multiple simulation modes, optional proxy configuration for controlled lab topologies, and real-time logging to monitor simulated activity effectively.
